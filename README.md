# HashTable

Impleamented in C++

The purpose of the program is to support fast look up, and fast insertion. The hash table is implemented by an array of pointers points to different linked list that stores data. Each string would have a hash value that indicates its location in the array, if the spot at the certain index in taken, the collion will be resolved by using seperate chaining with linked list. The data will be attached to the end of the linked list at that slot. The program also support finding the most frequently occured word, and look up a word by its frequency.
